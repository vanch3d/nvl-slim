{% block project_overview %}
<div class="p">The project is the result of collaboration between the Learning
	Sciences Research Institute (LSRI) and the NIHR National Biomedical
	Research Unit in Hearing (NBRUH). 
</div><div class="p">
	The aim of this project is to
	investigate how auditory perceptual learning, educational technologies
	and game design could be combined into an approach of training that is
	suitable for use by individuals outside the laboratory, e.g. on home
	computers, tablets or mobile devices. The approach I am taking is to
	re-consider how auditory training is delivered as a life-long and
	life-wide intervention, by establishing a clear distinction between
	auditory testing and auditory training, and therefore between the
	paradigms used in both cases. 
</div><div class="p">
	The work plan I developed focused on
	three interdependent aspects: 1) designing multiple casual games (i.e.
	extremely simple gameplay, short timespan commitment but increased
	impromptu return-to-task) for training on ranges of specific auditory
	tasks; 2) adapting or defining new user-centred adaptive methods
	suitable for micro-adaptation (i.e. at the level of game prompt),
	meso-adaptation (i.e. at the level of game structure) and
	macro-adaptation (i.e. at the level of intervention); 3) deploying the
	casual games within an intervention-based and user-centred platform. 
</div><div class="p">
	To achieve these aims, I have been pursuing a Design-Based Research
	approach, using participatory design, rapid and incremental
	prototyping, usability and desirability methods, as well as formative
	evaluations. In collaboration with one of the NBRUH team, I have been
	applying these principles for the design and evaluation of a game-based
	alternative to Auditory Discrimination Therapy (ADT) for Tinnitus. 
</div><div class="p">
	I am responsible of the design, implementation and evaluation of two
	game-based auditory training environments, to be tested against a
	traditional computer-based system in a clinical study with tinnitus
	patients. The efficacy of the newly-designed games will be compared
	both from an auditory learning point of view (e.g. changes in
	performance, improvement of tinnitus) and from a user engagement point
	of view (e.g. flow experience). The clinical study involves 60+
	participants in a 6-weeks home-training intervention, using each of the
	three games in a randomised controlled sequence. I am in charge of
	configuring and introducing the training equipment to participants, and
	running semi-structured interviews on desirability and usability at 3
	visit points during the intervention, eliciting participants'
	engagement with each of the three games. 
</div><div class="p">
	The study is still on-going,
	with participants expected until end of July 2012. An embargo on
	publications is in place until data are fully collected, analysed and
	consolidated (expected October 2012).
