<div class="p">The JISC-funded MyPlan project has targeted the independent lifelong
	learner by creating a web-based system that allows users to record and
	share their learning pathways, i.e. the record of every educational and
	personal life episodes that are seen as having an impact on their
	development. 
</div><div class="p">
	My responsibility in the second phase of the project was
	to develop functionalities for the personalised creation, searching and
	recommendations of learning pathways through courses and modules in
	Further and Higher Education. It involved the adaptation of techniques
	for user profiling and similarity matching of user pathways,
	specifically the use of string metrics. 
</div><div class="p">
	I was responsible for designing
	and running evaluations of the system (both usability and formative
	evaluation) as well as making recommendations for the definition of
	metadata specific to this particular context. A significant part of the
	project was dedicated to the redesign of the web-based user interface,
	in particular to support the visualisation of the pathways (using a
	timeline approach), their manipulation and comparison with those of
	other participants.
