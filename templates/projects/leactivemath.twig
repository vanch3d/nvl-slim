    <div class="p">
        <p>Student modelling has been an early research topic in Artificial Intelligence in Education; various
            techniques have been used to recognize and adapt to the student’s behaviour and knowledge. Currently, the
            major growth directions of research are in open student modelling, group modelling, and the modelling of
            affect, attitude, motivation and other aspects of the student beyond that of the student’s grasp of the
            content being learned.</p>

        <p>Open Learner Modelling (OLM), i.e., a scrutable, inspectable, and/or modifiable student model has been shown
            to improve the involvement and motivation of students, and also to encourage reflection on the student’s own
            state of knowledge.</p>

        <p>My contribution to the European FP6 project LeActiveMath was to precisely integrate an Open Learner Modelling
            approach into the web-based learning environment. Among the various tasks and scientific questions implied
            by such a collaborative project, I was particularly involved in three aspects of the project:

        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>the specification of an Extended Open Learner Model (xOLM), a multi-layered evidence-based model, based
                on a variant of Dempster-Shafer Theory (DST) and encompassing learners' abilities such as mathematical
                competency, affective and motivational factors, meta-cognition and misconceptions;
            <li>the design of the OLM component that support learners in exploring judgements made by the system, in
                inspecting justifications for such judgements and in challenging them;
            <li>the definition of various modes of visualisation of these evidence and argumentations, as well as the
                implementation of a dedicated user interface, to be deployed in the LeActiveMath system.
        </ol>
